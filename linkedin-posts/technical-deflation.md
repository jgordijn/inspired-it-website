"Clean code" is a bad investment.

For years, we've been practising "clean code". The rule was: code is read 10x more than it is written, so invest in readability now while you have the context.

But times are changing.

We live in a time of Technical Deflation. Code is getting cheaper to produce and maintain. In a deflationary environment, it makes sense to postpone investments today that don't give direct benefits.

If your technical debt is not blocking you right now, move on. Stop over-investing in making "perfect" code. As Dan Shapiro puts it in his latest blog: "You are borrowing expensive human hours today, and you will get to pay them back with cheap AI hours tomorrow."

Your clean code repo might be a beautiful museum piece, but it will be months behind the competition.
