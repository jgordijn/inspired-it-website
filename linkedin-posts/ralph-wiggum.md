I let an AI agent run unsupervised and came back to 35 commits in 30 minutes.

That felt… irresponsible. And also oddly liberating.

Most “human-in-the-loop” work is just micromanaging the robot.

Geoffrey Huntley coined the “Ralph Wiggum” pattern: one task, fresh context, stop. Repeat. No long chat history.

Instead of letting context bloat into a messy conversation, every iteration starts clean and focused.

Concrete result: 35 skills reviewed and improved in 30 minutes (35 clean commits) while I made coffee. Thanks to Jeroen Dee for helping me.

Are you ready to get on the loop?
