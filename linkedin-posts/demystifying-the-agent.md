"Which agent is best?" is becoming the new "which IDE is best?" It misses the point. Agents are mostly a delivery mechanism: instructions, tools, and a loop. The model decides what to do, which tools to use, and when it's done.

So the real leverage isn't swapping agents. It's better prompts, better context, and a better model. Even "skills" are simpler than people think: a name and a markdown file.

Together with Jeroen Dee I looked at the Pi Agent that's embracing this simplicity and geve me a lot of insight. 

Once you see the simplicity, you understand how to actually get the most out of these tools.
