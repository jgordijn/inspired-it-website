Last weekend I made a game with my 10-year-old son using AI.

He described what he wanted: a firework game with rockets that "fly up and explode with all the beautiful colors."

Within minutes, it worked. Then we made it 3D.

But the best part wasn't the game. It was his enthusiasm.

The next day he grabbed his iPad and started experimenting on his own. Creating images. Building new things. Coming up with ideas.

This is where kids get their superpowers. They can use their creativity to make things they couldn't make before.

Seeing this enthusiasm is really nice. But now he thinks my job is simple... 😉
