Pi just added this:

> • Added default skill auto-discovery for `.agents/skills` locations. Pi now discovers project skills from `.agents/skills` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo), and global skills from `~/.agents/skills`, in addition to existing `.pi` skill paths.

Nice improvement. OpenCode supports it too. It would be nice if it didn't stop at the Git repo root, but kept going up instead. That would allow for `~/projects/clientA/.agents` and `~/projects/clientB/.agents` — all projects for a specific client could inherit the correct skills.
