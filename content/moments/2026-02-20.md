Pi just added this:

> • Added default skill auto-discovery for `.agents/skills` locations. Pi now discovers project skills from `.agents/skills` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo), and global skills from `~/.agents/skills`, in addition to existing `.pi` skill paths.

Nice improvement. OpenCode supports it too. It would be nice if it didn't stop at the Git repo root, but kept going up instead. That would allow for `~/projects/clientA/.agents` and `~/projects/clientB/.agents` — all projects for a specific client could inherit the correct skills.

I just made a release of agentdeps with `.agents` support for pi and opencode: [jgordijn/agentdeps:0.5.0](https://github.com/jgordijn/agentdeps/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

I wonder why people who are pro-AI feel the need to tone it down by saying that AI still makes errors. You still need to check. AI cannot do this or that. It's a user problem, not an AI problem. As [JD](https://aishepherd.nl/moments) says: PICNIM (Problem In Chair, Not In Model)

I can relate to this post by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/19/recovering-lost-code/#atom-everything). I sometimes find myself searching for something I think I made. Did I make it? Where did I do it?
