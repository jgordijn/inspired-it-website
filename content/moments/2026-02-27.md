People talk about liking one model or another, then say they've been using it for months. You should really try new models every time they come out and see if your verdict still holds.

[Linear walkthroughs](https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/linear-walkthroughs/) are an interesting idea. Need to test that tomorrow on a service I've implemented.

Tried the [Linear walkthroughs](https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/linear-walkthroughs/) today. That is really cool! The only problem I had was missing syntax highlighting. Luckily, my clanker came up with a 2-step solution for that. Really nice to have a guide to read the code.

I've been using GPT-5.3-Codex throughout the day. The context window of 400k vs the 120k of Opus (in GH Copilot) makes a real difference. Getting great results, and I'm starting to like GPT-5.3-Codex more and more. Would be nice if Opus on GH Copilot got a bigger context window too. I guess the request model is holding GH back.
