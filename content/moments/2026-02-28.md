Brutal blog post by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/real/):

> If your company has banned AI outright, you need to depart right now and find another employer.

The world is changing and people should no longer identify as programmer:

> This is going to be a really hard time for a lot of people because identity functions have been erased, and the hard thing is, it's not just software developers. It's people managers as well.

This is a must read and wake-up call for anyone thinking nothing is happening.
