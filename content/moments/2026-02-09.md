[Pi](https://pi.dev) is such a cool project. It makes me think in whole other ways about working with LLMs. No more magice, all logic is put in place by me. I still like [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as well. But using Pi I now better understand what's happening.

AI may make you more productive, but working more and more... I'm not alone: https://x.com/simonw/status/2020901645597683870?s=46

This shows the power of [Pi](https://pi.dev), if you can imagine it, you can build it: https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-prompt-template-model

Building a little bot for slack with AI using Claude Opus 4.6. Without asking, it builds integration with OpenAI's API. Why didn't it favor Claude SDK? Now that I switch to OpenRouter it becomes apparent that OpenRouter and Ollama are all using the OpenAI API, so I think OpenAI API is just more common.

Just set up a Slack bot in about 1h to add messages to my moments (<https://github.com/jgordijn/moments-slackbot>). This message was created via Slack. The power we get! An idea is now realized in no time 💪
