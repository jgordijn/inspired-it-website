Building my own RSS reader with AI summary and filtering. Using Minimax via OpenRouter is a massive cost reduction compared to using Anthropic Sonnet.

[Sonnet 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6) dropped. Nearing Opus 4.6 for lower cost. Better than Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5. Most information is about computer use, so apparently it's very good at that.

We need to build good services to win. Not the most popular. 🤔 Interesting thought!
