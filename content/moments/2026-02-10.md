After a remark about missing dark mode I gave the following prompt to Claude mobile app, in the code tab:

> The website has no dark mode. I need the site to have a dark mode. It should listen to system preference by default, but it should also be possible to toggle manually.
> The toggle should be easy to see but not too much in your face.
> Make a PR for this.

Now the site has dark mode!
