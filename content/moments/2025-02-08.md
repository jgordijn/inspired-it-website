Been experimenting with adding a microblog to the site. The idea is simple: quick notes and observations that don't need the full treatment of a blog post. Sometimes you just want to jot down a thought.

Found an interesting article on [static site generation patterns](https://example.com) — the approach of pre-rendering everything at build time keeps things beautifully simple.
