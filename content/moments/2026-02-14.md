OpenAI introduced [GPT-5.3-Codex Spark](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/) which can run at 1000 tokens/sec. But this has little value if your tech stack is slow in compiling and testing. Working with Kotlin and Spring with Maven, this is becoming a real pain.

For the first time, I can see myself actually doing some work on an iPad. [Echo SSH](https://replay.software/echo) is really nice. SSH into the dev server and start [pi](https://pi.dev) inside [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and you're off.

Pi has `/export`. It creates a nice export of the session to an HTML file.
