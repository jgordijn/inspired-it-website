  Two day hackathon. This event was primarily focused on introducing people to
  TUI based agents, like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code),
  [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Spec Driven Development was used as
  guidance. We used [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec).
