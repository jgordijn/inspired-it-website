ChatGPT has released a [new image generator](https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/), and seeing [Simon Willison's experiments](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/16/new-chatgpt-images/) with the new GPT image generator and infographics, I decided to try it on my own blog. In my previous post, [My AI Writes Code. Yours Can Too](/blog/my-ai-workflow), I described my workflow. I thought it would be a fun experiment to ask both GPT and Gemini to create an infographic of that workflow.

Here is the result.

## The Contenders

First up, the version generated by **GPT 5.2**.

It looks decent and it gets the point across. A few months back, this would have blown me away. But now, I don't find it really impressive. It's a little bit boring.

Now, look at what **Gemini** produced.

Wow! This image really impresses me. It shows a really nice, rich picture with all the details of the workflow. This is something which I would really be glad to put in a slide deck or anywhere I want to present it. It may be a little bit chaotic, but it's a really cool picture.

## The Verdict

Honestly? I'm impressed by the Gemini version. It just feels more comprehensive and visually stunning. The GPT version is nice and tidy, but Gemini wins for me.

Which one do you like more?
