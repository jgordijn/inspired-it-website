"Clean code" is a bad investment.

For years, we've been practising "clean code". Code is read ten times more often than it is written, so spending time to make it readable while you still know the context is a good investment. But times are changing. 

We live in a time of Technical Deflation. Code is getting cheaper to produce and maintain. When that is the case, it makes sense to postpone investments today that will not give direct benefits. To achieve the same, it will be cheaper in the future.

If the technical debt is not blocking you right now, move on. Stop over-investing in making perfect code. You'll do it later for a fraction of the price.
