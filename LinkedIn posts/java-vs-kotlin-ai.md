In the age of AI, Java could beat Kotlin.

For years, the "Java vs. Kotlin" debate was settled. Kotlin was the clear winner for developer happiness. But as I moved toward Level 6 on the AI Coding Ladder, I’ve realized the game has changed.

The "worse" language might actually be the better tool. The current state of Kotlin support outside of IntelliJ is a major bottleneck. As we move towards a world where autonomous AI agents rule and traditional IDEs fade, the "proprietary magic" of JetBrains doesn't travel.

Java was built on open standards that give AI the "vision" it needs to be truly smart. While we were enjoying Kotlin's concise syntax, we might have accidentally built a wall around our code that AI can't see through.

Are we entering an era where we prioritize machine-readability over human-conciseness?
