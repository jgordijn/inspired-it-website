In the age of AI, Java could beat Kotlin.

For years, the "Java vs. Kotlin" debate was settled. Kotlin was the clear winner for developer happiness. But as I moved toward Level 6 on the AI Coding Ladder, I see some issues going forward.

The "worse" language might actually be the better tool. The current state of Kotlin support outside of IntelliJ is a major bottleneck. We move towards a world where IDEs become obsolete and autonomous AI agents rule the world, and the proprietary magic of IntelliJ doesn't travel. Java’s mature, open-standard LSP (Language Server Protocol) can give AI the "vision" it needs to be truly smart.

Are we entering an era where we prioritize machine-readability over human-conciseness?
