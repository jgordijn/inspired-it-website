```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_ID');
</script>
```

## Updating Your Site

```

### Rebuild

```bash
npm run build
```

**GitHub Pages**: Automatic via Actions workflow
**Traditional Host**: Upload `out/` folder via FTP
**AWS**: Use AWS CLI or management console

## Performance Optimization

After deployment:

1. **Enable Caching**
   - Set cache headers for static files
   - Usually automatic on modern platforms

2. **Enable Compression**
   - Gzip compression for CSS/JS
   - Usually enabled by default

3. **Use CDN**
   - Vercel/Netlify handle this
   - CloudFront for AWS

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use PageSpeed Insights
   - Check Core Web Vitals

---

## Troubleshooting Deployment

### Site shows 404
- Check your build output directory
- Ensure static export is enabled in `next.config.js`
- Verify all files uploaded correctly

### Routes don't work
- Server needs to serve `index.html` for unknown routes
- Configure error document as `index.html`

### Slow performance
- Check Core Web Vitals
- Optimize images
- Enable caching

### Blog posts don't show
- Ensure posts are in `content/blog/` folder
- Check YAML frontmatter format
- Rebuild and redeploy
